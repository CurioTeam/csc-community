Curio StableCoin Governance Application is here [https://vote-stablecoin.curioinvest.com](https://vote-stablecoin.curioinvest.com).

There are 2 types of votes in Curio StableCoin Governance: **Executive** and **Polling**. **Executive voting** is used to vote for changes in the state of the StableCoin system (interest rates, adding new types of collateral, etc.). **Polls** are carried for other purposes, for example, to preliminarily evaluate the opinions of the community on any issue.  

To participate in the voting, you must have CGT tokens.  

For the **Executive voting**, the CGT must be placed on a special Voting contract - this will be the weight of the vote. For **Polling voting**, the balance on the wallet is used.

### How to participate in Polling

You must have any number of CGT tokens to participate in polls (tab Polling). You must select the poll and vote for the good option. For example, polling the community for the desired borrowing rate for a specific collateral type. Then the selected value can be submitted to the Executive voting (by Curio Team) for inclusion in the system. Also, using the Polling solved other issues regarding the growth of the ecosystem Curio StableCoin. It also resolves other issues regarding the growth of the Curio StableCoin ecosystem.  

Note: to participate in the Polling voting, it is not necessary to have CGTs blocked on the Voting contract and create a Voting contract. It is enough to have any number of CGTs in your wallet.

### How votes are calculated in Polling

When Poll is active, CGT holders can vote with a vote weight equal to the CGT balance on the wallet. The vote can be changed during the voting period. You can also transfer CGT tokens to another wallet, but then the weight of the vote will also change depending on the balance of the voting wallet. The voting result is determined by the CGT balances of the voting wallets in the **last block for the voting period**. The voting period is determined by the Curio team for a specific vote.
