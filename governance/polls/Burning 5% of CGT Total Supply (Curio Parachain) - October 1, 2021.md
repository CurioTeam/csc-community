# Poll: Burning 5% of CGT Total Supply (Curio Parachain) - October 1, 2021

Curio Team have placed a community poll into the Curio StableCoin voting system. This community poll will be active for 3 days beginning from October 1, 2021.

This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should vote 'Abstain'.

## Review

CGT token holders may vote in this poll to support or opposition to burning 5% (5,000,000 CGT) of CGT total supply. This piece of CGT will be burned on the [Curio Parachain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fparachain.curioinvest.com). Burning part of the CGT emission will reduce the CGT total supply.

## Outcomes

If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following action will be taken: 5% of CGT total supply will be burned.

If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.
